## Project Intro/Objective
(Real) GDP is a measure of the economic health of a nation.
We hypothesized that there is a correlation between petroleum / transportation-related indicators and Real GDP, as well as among these indicators themselves.

### Questions Asked
What is the relationship between our selected indicators set (below) and Real GDP in recent years (2007 to 2017)? 
 * Annual Miles, 
 * Average MPG, 
 * Price of Petroleum, and 
 * Consumption of Petroleum
* What is the relationship between price and other indicators?
* Are there other meaningful relationships between the other indicators?

## Methods Used
* Scatter Plots.
* Two-Variable Regression
* Multiple line graphs.
* Histograms
* T-Test

## Libraries and Platforms
* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib 
* OS
* Scipy 
* Seaborn

## Project Description
The five factors listed above all play a large role in our economy.

Knowing how they are related and affect each other could help us better construct policies in those industries.

Our goal was not to reperform or debunk the publications of data scientists or economists but to go about finding out for ourselves the significance of petroleum-related factors as inputs to real GDP and to each other.

Our data sources were:
* FRED Economic Data - U.S. GDP
* United States Department of Transportation - U.S. Avg MPG
* United States Department of Transportation - U.S. Annual Miles
* U.S. Energy Information Administration - U.S. Price of fuel
* U.S. Energy Information Administration - U.S. Consumption of fuel



## Project Steps
* Collect and convert all data into CSV.
* Merge, format, and consolidate all data into one CSV via python.
* Convert data into python data base.
* Use methods such as scatter plots and regression to analyze data.

## Needs of This project
* Ordinary Least Squares Regression for the top factors uncovered within our preliminary analysis to further understand the impact these factors jointly have on GDP. 
* Increase the time series to another decade or two to have a more comprehensive look.
* Disaggregation of data points.
